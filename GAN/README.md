# INTRODUCTION
An AI for the generation of images.
**The code is a slight variation of the tutorial code made by Google**, which can be found at the following link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan

**The original code is meant to be used on the MNIST dataset, with grayscale images.
My variation allows data scientists to create GANs directly using RGB images downloaded on your computer.**

I just wanted to do this project to learn more about GAN. 
**I hope you will be able to use this code to quickstart your projects.**

I used a custom dataset made of different pictures downloaded from Google Images on my PC thanks to a webscraping tool I have written.
For Copyright reasons, the dataset won't be made available.
The model is not ready yet.

# HOW IT WAS TRAINED
This jupyter notebook was written on Google Colab.
To improve the performance, it was decided to connect to the local runtime while using Google Colab.
This helped a lot during the training phase.
