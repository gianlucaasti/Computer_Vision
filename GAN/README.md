# GAN
An AI for the generation of fantasy images.
I just wanted to do this project to learn more about GAN.


# CODE
The code is a slight variation of the tutorial code made by Google, which can be found at the following link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan

The original code is meant to be used on the MNIST dataset, with grayscale images.
My variation allows data scientists to create GANs directly using "colored" images.
